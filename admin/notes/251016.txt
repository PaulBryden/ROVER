* Number of bits for packet size
* Expects response flag
* Last packet
* Special msg type for RD, or designate address for all nodes?
* CRC
* Behaviour on failure?
* RD: Multiple paths, flags?

Mechanical: 9cm/sec likely top speed

size (6 bits): size of packet in bytes (0 for 64 bytes)
flags (5 bits): bit field for packet flags, such as prioritise, expects response, delivery failed... remaining bits are reserved for future use
msg (5 bits): message id, used to make sure packets are matched up correctly
target (8 bits): target service id
source (8 bits): source service id
packet (8 bits): packet number
crc (8 bits): crc-8 code
